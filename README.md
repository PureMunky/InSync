_Not to be confused with the ravenously popular boy band of the late 90's_

## About

This project aims to create awareness over a network that allows the devices on it to "talk" with each other about what the others are doing and act accordingly. The end result will be a seemless transition between devices without the loss of information giving a sense of unity throughout your network that allows for interaction with the whole network as one device instead of interconnected devices.

## Example

If you're browsing for funny cat videos on your phone your desktop will recognize the activity and launch helpful side actions.
